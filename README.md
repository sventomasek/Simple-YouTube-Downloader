Hello! This is a simple tool used for downloading video or audio files from YouTube.

So first you should have Python installed, so if you don't have it already go and get it! https://www.python.org/downloads/
Also make sure to install "pytube" and "moviepy" which you can do manually or by using the provided "install.bat" file.

To use it just open "start.bat", then it will ask you for the video URL which should look something like "https://youtu.be/hcr02D5D_Iw".
Paste the URL in there and then it will ask which format you want to use. If you choose mp4 you will get the whole video but if you choose mp3 or wav you will get both a video and an audio file.
After choosing the format it should download the video and you should be happy (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻

Obviously make sure to visit my GitHub (https://github.com/sventomasek) and my video games (https://sventomasek.itch.io/)
